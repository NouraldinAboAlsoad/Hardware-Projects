ðŸ§² Industrial-Grade Data Acquisition System
Description:
A high-precision, multi-sensor data acquisition system designed for industrial and research-grade applications. Built around the ESP32 microcontroller, the system supports concurrent interfacing with 18 thermocouples, 6 strain gauges, and a digital SHT85 temperature/humidity sensor. Designed for long-term environmental and structural monitoring, the board also includes real-time clock (RTC) functionality and local data logging via SD card.

Key Features:

Supports 18x thermocouples and 6x strain gauges with high-resolution analog front-end

Integrated SHT85 digital sensor for temperature and humidity readings

Real-time clock (RTC) for accurate timestamping

Onboard SD card slot for long-term data storage

ESP32-based Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring

Optimized for structural diagnostics, thermal profiling, and environmental sensing

Technologies Used:

ESP32 microcontroller with FreeRTOS

SPI, I2C, ADC interfacing

SD card file system integration (FAT32)

SHT85 via I2C

RTC module (DS3231 or equivalent)

Thermocouple amplifier (e.g., MAX31856 or similar)

Outcomes:

Enables accurate, synchronized logging across multiple sensor types

Designed for industrial field deployment with scalable firmware architecture

Suitable for research labs, industrial inspection, and IoT-based remote diagnostics
