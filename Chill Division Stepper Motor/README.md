ðŸŒ€ Chill Division â€“ IoT-Based Stepper Motor Control System
Description:
Chill Division is a Wi-Fi-enabled motor control system designed to automate the operation of high-current stepper motors used in peristaltic pumping applications. 
Built for harsh industrial environments, the system integrates STM32 microcontrollers, power isolation, and IoT connectivity to deliver reliable, real-time motor control.

Key Features:

Controls 4x stepper motors (up to 2.5A each) with precision and isolation

STM32F4-based control board with embedded firmware

Galvanic isolation between high-current drivers and microcontroller for enhanced safety

Wi-Fi module for wireless configuration and monitoring

Designed for use in automated chilling and dosing systems

Technologies Used:

Altium Designer (custom motor control PCB)

Embedded C (STM32 HAL)

Motor control drivers (TB6600)

Galvanic isolation circuits

Wi-Fi stack for remote access

Outcomes:

Successfully deployed in automated pump systems

Delivered reliable operation under electrically noisy conditions

Modular and scalable design for broader industrial automation use cases

Demonstrated robust integration of hardware, firmware, and networked control
