ðŸšš Ref Truck â€“ GSM/GPS-Enabled Cold Chain Monitoring System
Description:
Ref Truck is a custom-engineered cold chain monitoring system designed for refrigerated transportation. It integrates GPS, GSM, and multi-sensor modules to provide real-time data on location, temperature, humidity, and door status of refrigerated trucks. The system was built from the ground up with custom PCB hardware, efficient power delivery, and robust embedded firmware to ensure accuracy and reliability in harsh mobile environments.

Key Features:

Real-time tracking of truck location, speed, and internal environmental conditions

STM32-based custom hardware with 3.3V/3A & 4V/3A buck converters

GSM module for wireless data transmission

Integrated temperature, humidity, and door sensors

Protection circuits (short circuit, overcurrent, undervoltage, polarity)

Technologies Used:

Altium Designer (PCB layout & BOM)

Embedded C (STM32 HAL)

GSM communication 

Sensor interfacing (Analog/Digital)

Power management (Buck Converter at 92% efficiency)

Outcomes:

Deployed across 10+ refrigerated trucks

Achieved 99.8% sensor data accuracy

Reduced energy consumption by 20% with efficient power design

Delivered robust, field-tested industrial performance
